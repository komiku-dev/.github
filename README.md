# Hello, and welcome to Komiku.

## Our Philosophy
We are guided by a core set of beliefs that shape everything we build. We believe that foundational technology should be open to foster innovation and prevent vendor lock-in. We build our tools to empower creators—the heart of the industry—giving them more control and helping them reach a global audience. Above all, we are committed to making content accessible to everyone by design, ensuring it is a core feature, not an afterthought.

## Our Vision
Our vision is a future where digital comics and novels are truly global and dynamic. We see a world where any story can be read by anyone, in any language, on any device—not as a static image, but as a rich, interactive experience. By breaking down the technical and linguistic barriers that exist today, we aim to foster a more interconnected and vibrant community of creators and readers.

## Our Approach
We take a holistic approach by building a vertically integrated ecosystem. By developing the foundational format ourselves, we ensure that our Creator Studio, Translation Platform, and reader applications are deeply integrated. This allows for a seamless experience from creation to consumption, something not possible when relying on disparate, legacy formats.

## Our Commitment to Open Source
Openness is central to our strategy. Our foundational project, the Open Webtoon Format, is and always will be developed as a free and open-source standard under the permissive MIT License. We believe this is the only way to build a truly universal standard that benefits the entire community, and we actively welcome contributors to help us shape its future.

[^1]: This includes a wide range of sequential art, such as webtoons, manga, manhwa, and traditional comics.
[^2]: "Dynamic" means treating elements like text, speech bubbles, and sound effects as separate layers from the artwork, allowing for interactivity and on-the-fly translation.
