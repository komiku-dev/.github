# Hello, and welcome to Komiku.

## Our Philosophy
We are guided by a core set of beliefs that shape everything we build. We believe that foundational technology should be open to foster innovation and prevent vendor lock-in. We build our tools to empower creators—the heart of the industry—giving them more control and helping them reach a global audience. Above all, we are committed to making content accessible to everyone by design, ensuring it is a core feature, not an afterthought.

## Our Vision
Our vision is a future where digital comics and novels are truly global and dynamic. We see a world where any story can be read by anyone, in any language, on any device—not as a static image or simple text file, but as a rich, interactive experience. By breaking down the technical and linguistic barriers that exist today, we aim to foster a more interconnected and vibrant community of creators and readers.

## Our Approach
We take a holistic approach by building a vertically integrated ecosystem. By developing the foundational formats ourselves, we ensure that our Creator Studio, Translation Platform, and reader applications are deeply integrated. This allows for a seamless experience from creation to consumption, something not possible when relying on disparate, legacy formats.

## Our Commitment to Open Source
Openness is central to our strategy. Our foundational projects, including the **WebNovel Standard** and the **Webtoon Standard**, are and always will be developed as free and open standards under the permissive MIT License. We believe this is the only way to build truly universal standards that benefit the entire community, and we actively welcome contributors to help us shape their future.

## The Komiku Ecosystem
We are developing an integrated suite of platforms designed to support the entire lifecycle of a digital publication, from creation to translation and reading.

* **Komiku Platform**
    A website and mobile application for reading graphic novels[^1] and novels.

* **Komiku Translate**
    A dedicated platform designed to streamline the process of translating comics and novels for a global audience.

* **Komiku Creator Studio**
    An integrated platform that provides creators with the tools they need to publish and manage their work.

## Our Open-Source Foundation
The engine that will power the future of our ecosystem is a set of modern, open standards.

* **[WebNovel Standard]([link-to-webnovel-repo](https://github.com/komiku-dev/open-webnovel-format))**
    A structured file format for webnovels and serialized fiction, designed to be portable, translation-ready, and workflow-aware, giving authors full control over their work.

* **[Webtoon Standard]([link-to-webtoon-repo](https://github.com/komiku-dev/open-webtoon-format/tree/main))**
    A new file format standard we are developing to make digital comics more dynamic[^2], accessible, and easier to translate.

> [!NOTE]
> Our standards are community-driven **open-source** initiatives. By building them in the open, we aim to modernize the entire digital publishing industry. We welcome all contributors.

[^1]: This includes a wide range of sequential art, such as webtoons, manga, manhwa, and traditional comics.
[^2]: "Dynamic" means treating elements like text, speech bubbles, and sound effects as separate layers from the artwork, allowing for interactivity and on-the-fly translation.
